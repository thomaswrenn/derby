How Do I Use Derby?
===================

## Autocompletions

Autocompletions are very self explanatory. These are snippets that are much shorter and are not weighted as heavily in Sublime Text. They just help you autocomplete complicated phrases very quickly. They work just like snippets too!

To run an autocomplete, type in the property you are looking for and hit `Tab`. Most of the time you don't have to type this much as fuzzy searching in Sublime will catch it earlier. Here is an example with `:` representing the `Tab` key.
	
	animation : @include animation(scale 1.0s ease-in);

## Docs

Derby's *docs* section is composed of snippets that are meant to serve as a reference and a teaching aid. These *docs* can be called on at any time by typing `docs` and then the reference you are looking for (exp: `Animation` or `BoxSizing`). While Bourbon, Neat and SASS are powerful tools, sometimes integrating them into production can be difficult, especially when first learning them. To have a reference at hand should help tremendously! I have even tried to hunt down and reference as many arguments as I can that you can pass into these mixins when applicable.
